The idea of building up this website came from a graduation event. Although all of our team members were not specialist in building up large scale website like this nor specialists in defining UI and UX, being positive and insistent, we manage to achieve some outcomes. Here we proudly present our team!

                    <p>Fei is an engineering student in HKUST. Inspired by Google Docs in a graduation event, he gathered outstanding engineers that he knew to build up this site. Having done some projects before, he simply and sometimes naively believed that he and his teammates were building the next Facebook. After excellent performance of his teammates, he now regards this as an opportunity to learn CSS. He likes this team and hope everyone enjoys this site!
