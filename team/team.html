                        Inspired by Google Docs in a graduation event, he gathered outstanding engineers in HKUST to build up this site. He simply and sometimes naively believed that he and his teammates were building the next Facebook, and he inspires the whole team with his “naivetés”. He did great contributions in defining this product. Fei is a great engineer and a humble learner. He falls in love with CSS (only one of the serveral things that he could do) in this project. He likes this team and hope everyone enjoys this site!
